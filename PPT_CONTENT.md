## Problem Statement

**Supply Chain Disruptions & Unreliable Suppliers Cost Enterprises Millions**

• **Reactive Supplier Evaluation**: Traditional methods only identify issues after they occur
• **Lack of Predictive Capabilities**: No early warning system for supplier reliability risks
• **Manual Risk Assessment**: Time-intensive processes with human bias and inconsistency
• **Poor Vendor Selection**: Limited data-driven insights for choosing alternative suppliers
• **Supply Chain Blind Spots**: Insufficient visibility into supplier performance trends
• **Financial Impact**: Supply disruptions can cost enterprises $50M+ annually

**The Need**: An AI-powered proactive system that predicts supplier reliability, flags high-risk orders, and recommends alternatives before disruptions occur.
