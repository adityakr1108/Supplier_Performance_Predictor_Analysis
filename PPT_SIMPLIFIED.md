## Problem Statement

**Supply Chain Disruptions & Unreliable Suppliers Cost Enterprises Millions Annually**

Traditional supplier evaluation methods are reactive and lack predictive capabilities, leading to:
• Supply chain disruptions costing enterprises $50M+ annually
• Manual risk assessment with human bias and inconsistency
• Poor vendor selection due to limited data-driven insights
• No early warning system for supplier reliability risks
• Insufficient visibility into supplier performance trends

**Solution Needed**: An AI-powered proactive system that predicts supplier reliability, flags high-risk orders, and recommends alternatives before disruptions occur.
